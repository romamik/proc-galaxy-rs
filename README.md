# Procedural galaxy in Rust
## About the project

This should be procedural generated galaxy. Main purpose of this project is to teach myself rust.

Final result should be a program that after running displays a galaxy and allows user to pan and zoom in and out. This galaxy should be procedurally generated. There should be a lot of stars and user should be able to zoom in to any star to view it in detail.
